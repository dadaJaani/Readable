## Readable Project

This is the second project I developed while learning React through the React Nanodegree course provided by Udacity. I have used React, Redux and server that was provided by Udacity. <br>
This web app is a blog website. People can publish their articles, and then other users can either like/dislike or comment on these posts. The comments can also be liked or disliked. <br><br> 

First the api server has to be run on a seperate terminal/command prompt and then the web app will start working.

To run the app, first you need to install all the dependencies using `npm install` and then use `npm start` to run the app.
